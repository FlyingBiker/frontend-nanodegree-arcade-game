Welcome to Kevin's version of Udacity's frogger.

To begin, double-click on index.html, or right-click and select your favorite
browser.
Use the arrow keys to move the player up, down, left and right.
Your goal is to reach the water without getting hit by a bug.
If you are hit by a bug, you'll be sent back to the bottom to start all over.
If you make it to the water, you win, and your reward is to be sent back down
to the grass to try again.
Enjoy!!!
